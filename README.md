# Cedar EventStore

Cedar Event Store is an event store library for .NET

**This project is under heavy development at this time.**

Key design considerations:

 - Designed to primarily support RDMBS\SQL implementations
 - Highly API and behaviorally compatible with [EventStore](https://geteventstore.com/)
 - Async by default
 - JSON only event and metadata payloads
 - No in-built snapshot support; can be implemented externally
 - Leverage RDBMS specific notifications for low latency catch-up subscriptions
 - No support for `System.Transaction` enforcing the stream as the consistency / transaction boundary.

**TODO** See wiki for feature implementation status.

[CI Feed](https://www.myget.org/F/cedar/api/v2) - note very unstable.
